# Examples of some algorithms

## Description 

Selected examples of algorithms in the field of computer science and data science

## Sorting and search algorithms
The folder sort_and_searh contains the following example algorithms:
1. binary search,
2. select sort,
3. quick sort and
4. examples of using recursion.

## Graphs algorithms 
In the Graphs_algorithms folder you will find the following algorithms implementations:
1. breadth first search and
2. dijkstra algorithm

## Greedy algorithm 
The example of the implementation of the greedy algorithm, can be found in the Greedy_algorithm folder. This algorithm was used to find the smallest number of radio stations broadcasting in specific cities.

## Dynamic programing
In example located in dynamic_programing folder the dynamic programming technique was used. Algorithm of program choose the most valuable items form the collection. Each item has two characteristics: size and value. The sum of the values must be maximum and the selected items must fit into a limited space. 

## Same examples of machine learning and data science algorithms
1. **k-nearest neighbors.** In this example (k-nearest neighbors algorithm folder) K-NN algorithm was used. This algorithm was used to implement a book recommendation system. The new user receives a list of books that he may like based on books read by his closest neighbors in accordance with k-NN

2. **Naive Bayes classifier.** In this example (Naive_Bayes_classifier folder) naive Bayes classifier was used to determine the probability that the customer owns a car based on information about the customer. The program is learned on the basis of data obtained from previous clients.

## Technologies
